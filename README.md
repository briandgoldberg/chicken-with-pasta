A project for New York Blockchain Week

The purpose of this project is to allow merchants to accept USD payments without paying merchant services fees.  There are 2 experiences we need to build, merchants and buyers.  Our hackathon entry will focus on the merchant UX. We will empower merchants to generate payment QR codes and withdraw USD to their bank account.  We aim for merchants to only leave our bot to complete KYC requirements.
